      <div class="grid-element10">Chuang Tzu was a philosopher in ancient China, who, one night went to sleep and dreamed that he was a butterfly. He dreamt that he was flying around from flower to flower and while he was dreaming he felt free, blown about by the breeze hither and thither. He was quite sure that he was a butterfly. But when he awoke he realised that he had just been dreaming, and that he was really Chuang Tzu dreaming he was a butterfly. But then Chuang Tzu asked himself the following question: "was I Chuang Tzu dreaming I was a butterfly or am I now really a butterfly dreaming that I am Chuang Tzu?"</div>

        <p>website 0.3 by Henrik. test and text space for future work. Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
          Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
              While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
          As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
          “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
                      Only this and nothing more.”
          
              Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
          And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
              Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
              From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
          For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
                      Nameless here for evermore.</p>
